After every set of exercises from [freeCodeCamp responsive web-design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) course, I also did the respective projects, which you will see above.
Doing these projects, brought me a [freeCodeCamp Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/iuli-Obreja/responsive-web-design)
